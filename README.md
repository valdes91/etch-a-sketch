# etch-a-sketch

## About

This is my attempt at the etch a sketch project from The Odin Project. This is one of the last projects in the foundations section and is meant to sharpen my DOM manipulation skills as well as exercise my ability to google things to fill gaps in my knowledge to get my code to do what I want it to.
